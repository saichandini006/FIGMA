# DESCRIPTION

I performed confidently and creatively while designing my logo in Figma. From the beginning, I focused on understanding the purpose and message the logo needed to convey, which helped shape my design direction. I explored various design elements—such as shapes, icons, and typography—while keeping the brand identity in mind. Using Figma’s powerful tools, I was able to build clean vector shapes, adjust alignments precisely, and apply consistent spacing for a balanced look. I carefully selected colors that complemented each other and reflected the tone of the brand. Throughout the process, I iterated on my ideas, improved the design based on feedback or personal reflection, and used version control to track my progress. I made sure the logo was scalable, versatile, and visually appealing across different use cases. Overall, I demonstrated strong visual sense, technical skill, and a thoughtful design approach, resulting in a logo that I’m proud of.
